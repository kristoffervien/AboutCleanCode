This project demonstrates how to build a web application using Asp.Net following Uncle Bob's 
[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

The purpose of the application is to visualize the backlog of agile teams from various perspectives
to improve the transparency of the planned work as well as the teams velocity.

The project does not provide a "ready to use" implementation, it rather sketches how such a project could
be set up and how certain aspects could be designed and implemented following the rules of the Clean Architecture.
